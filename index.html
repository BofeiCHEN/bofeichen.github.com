<a id="---welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#---welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a> Profile</h2>

<p>Bofei CHEN was born in 2th September, 1987 in Yuzhou, Henan, China. In 2010, he obtained his Bachelor of Engineering degree in Detection, Guidance and Control Technology from the College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University. After this, he was recommended to continue his master education in the same college. He received his Master of Engineering Dedegree in Control Theory and Control Engineering in 2013.</p>

<p>In October 2013, he was sponsored by the Chinese Scholarship Council to become a PhD candidate at the Department of Informatique of <a href="http://www.utbm.fr/">UTBM</a>. In his PhD project, he worked on the cooperative control of intelligent vehicles. His research interests include artificial intelligence, intelligent vehicle, cooperative control and multi-agent system.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resume of professional experience</h3>

<p>I have a solid background in computer science, control theory and engineering, navigation system, including vehicle motion control, vehicles cooperative control, multi-agent system and also vessels motion control. During the research work, I have also practiced some skills, such as simulating in Matlab, developing software in Java and C++. I am currently searching for an job in control system designing and developing for vehicle motion or software development in relative areas.</p>

<p>As a PhD candidate of UTBM, my research work is focusing on the intelligent vehicles cooperative control to improve the traffic flow efficient, reduce the congest. The situation where several vehicles need interact is researched, such as encountering in roundabout or crossroad. I have developed one cooperative control model to organize vehicles based on multi-agent system, where every vehicle is assigned one agent and some vehicles compose to one vehicles-train. One multi-level decision algorithm is also developed and implemented in Java. Simulation is carried out in  Virtual Intelligent Vehicle Urban Simulator (VIVUS) developed in Unity. I also have improved the VIVUS to implement roundabout and crossroad scenario. Details in my <a href="../pages/phdexperience.html">PhD experience</a></p>

<p>Not only the cooperative control which deals with the group of objectives, I also have the experience of designing the motion controller for individual carrier. In the Master period, my main research work is set in the ship motion control, keeping ship in one presetting point through adapting the thrust including the strength and direction. The mathematic model of ship, wave, wind and current are studied. One filter is developed based on Kalman Filter to deal with the noise in sensors data. The simulation work is finished in Matlab. At the same time, I have taken part in the development of one human-machine interface of ship motion control system in BestSea Assembly Institute in Harbin Engineering University, which is developed in Qt and using C++.</p>

<p>My specialty as a Bachelor candidate is Detection, Navigation and Control System which provide a broad view for research work. My professional courses include the control theory and application, navigation theory and system, computer theory and application and so on.</p>

<p>I have also hold lots of experience in organization, such as organizing my classmates to take part in the Athletics of our college on May 2008 and achieve third place out of 40 classes, organizing one ten people basketball team to compete with other team in graduate basketball competition.</p>
